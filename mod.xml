[code]Commander, you're here. Good.

We've been assigned operations in the contaminated zones. The areas are still unstable; Hostile forces have moved in, taken hostages, fortified positions. Someone needs to clear them out.

I know it's dangerous work, but... we'll be careful. Just give us the orders and we'll see it through.

What do you say, Commander?[/code]

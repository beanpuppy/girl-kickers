[code]Commander, you&apos;re here. Good.

We&apos;ve been assigned operations in the contaminated zones. The areas are still unstable; Hostile forces have moved in, taken hostages, fortified positions. Someone needs to clear them out.

I know it&apos;s dangerous work, but... we&apos;ll be careful. Just give us the orders and we&apos;ll see it through.

What do you say, Commander?[/code]

@GFL-UNIT-DEFY-NAME=Task Force DEFY
@GFL-UNIT-DEFY-DESC=An elite team of newer model Tactical Dolls capable of great autonomy in the field, hence the name of the team. They form the most effective combat squad in the Neo-Soviet Union.
@#GFL-UNIT-DEFY-NAME-RND=Task Force DEFY

@DOLL-AK15-DESC=A girl who looks quite vicious, she's taller than most other Dolls. She's serious and prioritizes efficiency in her words and deeds. She gives people the impression of lacking emotion, but her wrath is frightening.
@WEAP-AK15-NAME=AK-15
@WEAP-AK15-DESC=The AK-15 is a variant of the AK-12 chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Both the AK-12 and AK-15 were developed by the Kalashnikov Group as part of the "Ratnik" ("Warrior", Russian future infantry combat system) program, and have been accepted into Russian military service.

@DOLL-AN94-DESC=A Doll from the Neo-Soviet Union’s Bureau of State Security and the prototype for the Wolf Pack Project, now leader of Task Force DEFY. Ten years ago, she helped the Commander to complete the decapitation operation in Frankfurt, then signed an agreement of conditional freedom of action with StateSec. She spent the last ten years countering Paradeus activities in the Yellow Zone. After becoming the leader of DEFY, she’s taken over her former partner as the new alpha wolf, earned the respect of her squad members and became better at socializing. What she wants is for Task Force DEFY to endure, and to unravel Paradeus’ new plot.
@WEAP-AN94-NAME=AN-94
@WEAP-AN94-DESC=The AN-94, or Avtomat Nikonova 1994, is a 5.45x39mm caliber gas-operated Russian firearm made by PO Izhmash made during Project Abakan.

The GRAU designation for the AN-94 is '6P33'.

@GFL-UNIT-404-NAME=H.I.D.E 404
@GFL-UNIT-404-DESC=An mercenary unit of tactical dolls specialising in covert operations and electronic warfare, known for completing contracts through any means necessary regardless of collateral damage.
@#GFL-UNIT-404-NAME-RND=H.I.D.E 404

@DOLL-HK416-DESC=Elegant and composed; a Doll brimming with confidence. She aspires to make every member of H.I.D.E. 404 into an elite. Only those who are familiar with her know the tenderness that lies behind her cold, strong-willed demeanor.
@WEAP-HK416-NAME=HK416
@WEAP-HK416-DESC=The Heckler & Koch HK416 is a collaboration project between the US Army Delta Force R&D department and the German firearms company Heckler & Koch, at the request of US Army combat veteran Larry Vickers. The goal was to make a M4 variant that has a shorter profile and lacks the AR-15's direct impingement system.

@DOLL-G11-DESC=A Doll who approaches everything with peak laziness, except for gaming and reading manga. She's mastered the ultimate skill: falling asleep anytime, anywhere, under any circumstance. Although she seems to embody the philosophy of "lying flat" to the extreme, she reveals her dependable side in times of crisis, though in her words, "It'd be better if we just never ran into any 'crisis' at all".
@WEAP-G11-NAME=G11
@WEAP-G11-DESC=During the Cold War, caseless ammunition was one of NATO's top projects, in order to achieve both easier ammunition storage/logistics and faster rate of fire. In the end, almost every project ended in failure or lost interest, with the exception of Heckler & Koch's G11. In theory, caseless munitions can achieve faster rates of weapon fire, since the process of the bolt unlocking followed by brass extraction and ejection is not needed with a bullet that doesn't come with a case; the weapon only needs to fire, load a new cartridge, and repeat.
@firearm_caliber_473x33_name=4.73×33mm Caseless
@ammo_473_caseless_name=4.73x33mm Caseless
@ammo_473_caseless_desc=Revolutionary caseless ammunition. No brass ejection, higher capacity magazines, and extremely high rate of fire in burst mode.

@DOLL-G36K-DESC=A gentle Doll whose sweet smile and gaze could melt ice and snow. But if she's been looking and smiling at you for too long, she's probably crashed. Because of this quirk, Andoris cannot give it her all on the battlefield. But what she lacks in firepower, she makes up for in intelligence gathering. Andoris is an expert intelligence officer due to her large storage space, and can pick up details anyone else would have missed. Using her abilities outside of the battlefield, Andoris has found a way of life and a home.
@WEAP-G36K-NAME=G36K-KSK
@WEAP-G36K-DESC=The G36K (for kurz, “short”), is the shortened, carbine version of the G36 introduced by Heckler & Koch in 1997. Andoris uses a G36KA4, the variant used since 2022 by the Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK), the special forces of the German Army.

@DOLL-G28-DESC=Innocent, peppy and a skilled mood maker Doll. She may seem harmless, but is always preparing some secret prank. Nothing wrong with a bit of levity! And there's nobody who couldn't forgive those big doe eyes and cute smile! But the fragile flower facade drops when she steps on the battlefield: even with her good performances, Belka never spares any effort. She aims to become an elite T-Doll like her Big Sis, and be useful to both her and the Commander. Her deepest desire is simply to remain by the side of the people she cherishes.
@WEAP-G28-NAME=G28
@WEAP-G28-DESC=G28 is the Bundeswehr designation for HK241 semi-automatic 7.62mm calibre designated marksman rifle designed by Heckler & Koch. Designed based on the civilian variant HK417 battle rifle the MR308, Heckler & Koch had given the name HK241 to G28 in October 2017, but the army designation remains the same. G28 shares approximately 75% interchangeable parts with HK417.

@DOLL-UMP45-DESC=A Doll born from conspiracy. The former leader of H.I.D.E. 404, now working with Lenna on confidential missions for the Non-Military Forces Administration. She always wears a smile and a polite demeanor, concealing the personality of a fox. Once your guard has been lowered with a smile, she will get what she wants with sharp words and outmaneuver you before you could react, smiling playfully all the while. Her close ones know what the smile truly conceals: the determination to protect people important to her. When danger appears, the fox becomes a lion and bares its sharp fangs.
@WEAP-UMP45-NAME=UMP45
@WEAP-UMP45-DESC=The UMP (Universale Maschinenpistole, German for "Universal Submachine Gun") is a submachine gun developed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch.

Her occupation and bodies have changed, but she's remains the same and will give you a big smile and hug when you're reunited.
@WEAP-UMP9-NAME=UMP9
@WEAP-UMP9-DESC=As the name signifies, the UMP9 is the UMP variant chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge.

The effective firing range is listed as being close to 100m.

@DOLL-VECTOR-DESC=A regularly pessimistic Doll. However, as the leader of H.I.D.E. 404's Team B, Vector will absolutely push through and endure till the very last moment with her teammates in the face of adversity, no matter how depressing the outcomes of her calculations.
@WEAP-VECTOR-NAME=KRISS Vector
@WEAP-VECTOR-DESC=The KRISS Vector is a series of weapons based upon the parent submachine gun design developed by the American firearms company KRISS USA, formerly Transformational Defense Industries (TDI). The various weapons in the Vector family use an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with an in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb.

Gentle, unyielding, kind and rational, she's the picture of reliability for her loved ones, and her personality attracts a wide variety of people to her. She's not above bending the rules to get her way, however… But you won't tell anybody, right?
